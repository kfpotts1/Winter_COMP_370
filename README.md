# Winter_COMP_370
COMP 370, Ithaca College, Completion of independent study, which blends Python
data science, finance, and statistics. The main focus of the project is to
learn common Python data analysis techniques, application and implementation of
financial computations in Python, apply these techniques to
a financial data research project, then finally code a trading algorithm
based off the reseach on Quantopian's open source Zipline backtester.

I have finished working through lectures and tutorials with examples and have
moved into researching ideas, which is being done in Jupyter Notebooks. The 
first two research notebooks are titled Market_Normality_Research_Part_1.ipynb
and Market_Normality_Research_Part_2.ipynb which can be viewed here on github. 
Currently the remaining files are notes, data, and resources used in the
ongoing project. More notebooks with different research focuses will be uploaded
soon. I am nearly complete with the research portion of the project and I am
beginning the trading algorithm development portion on Zipline which aims to
implement some of the ideas explored in the data research. 

I have also completed Quantopian and other Data Science lectures and tutorials
which will be uploaded in their own folders soon.
