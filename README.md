# Winter_COMP_370
COMP 370, Ithaca College, Completion of independent study, which blends Python
data science, finance, and statistics. The main focus of the project is to
learn common data analysis techniques in Python, apply these techniques to
a financial data research project, then finally code a trading algorithm
based off the reseach on Quantopian's platform.

I have finished working through lectures and tutorials with examples and have
moved into researching ideas, which is being done in Jupyter Notebooks. The 
first notebook is titled 1_Market_Normality_Research.ipynb which can be used on
github. Currently the remaining files are notes, data, and resources used in the
ongoing project. More notebooks with different research focuses will be uploaded
soon. I hope to be nearly complete with the research portion during the begining of
next week, January 10th or 11th, at which point I will begin writing a trading
algorithm in Python on Quantopian which aims to implement some of the ideas
explored in the data research. 

I have also completed Quantopian and other Data Science lectures and tutorials
which will be uploaded in their own folders soon.
