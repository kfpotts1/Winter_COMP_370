These are lectures created by Delaney Granizo-Mackenzie, head of academic reseach at Quantopian.
Many of them have been craeted in collaboration with professors at various universities who teach
quantitative investing courses. I completed these lectures, have experimented with the material,
as well as added some of my own code, material, and altercations to the notebooks for better
explanations and clearification. I worked on the norebooks locally rather than on Quantopian's
research site, and therefore used pandas and Yahoo! Finance for gathering data when necessary
because I did not have access to Quantopian's data while offline. I figured it would also be
good practive to retreive and clean the data when necessary myself.
