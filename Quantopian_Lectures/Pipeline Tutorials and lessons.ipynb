    "`DataSets` are simply collections of objects that tell the Pipeline API where and how to find to inputs to computations. An example of a `DataSet` that we have already seen is `USEquityPricing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `BoundColumn` is a column of data that is concretely bound to a `DataSet`. Instances of `BoundColumns` are dynamically created upon access to attributes of `DataSets`.  Inputs to pipline computations must be of type `BoundColumn`. A example of a `BoundColumn` that we have already seen is `USEquityPricing.close`.\n",

    "It is important to understand that `DataSets` and `BoundColumns` do not hold actual data. Remember that when computations are created and added to a pipeline, they don't actually perform the computation until the pipeline is run. `DataSets` and `BoundColumns` can be though of in a similar way; they are simply used to identify the inputs of a computation. The data is populated when the pipeline is run.\n",

    "When defining pipeline computations, we need to know the types of our inputs in order to know which operations and functions we can use. The `dtype` of a `BoundColumn` tells a computation what the type of the data will be when the pipeline is run. For example, `USEquityPricing` has a `float` `dtype` so a factor may perform arithmetic operations on `USEquityPricing.close` (e.g. compute the 5-day mean). The importance of this will become more clear in the next lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dtype` of a `BoundColumn` can also determine the type of a computation. In the case of the  `latest` computation, the `dtype` determines whether the computation is a factor (`float`), a filter (`bool`), or a classifier (`string`,`int`).\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered the basic components of the Pipeline API, let's construct a pipeline that we might want to use in an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, let's first create a filter to narrow down the types of securities coming out of our pipeline. In this example, we will create a filter to select for securities that meet the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is a primary share\n",
    "- Is listed as a common stock\n",
    "- Is not a [depositary receipt](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) (ADR/GDR)\n",
    "- Is not trading [over-the-counter](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/otc.asp) (OTC)\n",
    "- Is not [when-issued](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wi.asp) (WI)\n",
    "- Doesn't have a name indicating it's [limited partnership](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitedpartnership.asp) (LP)\n",
    "- Doesn't have company reference indicating it's a LP\n",
    "- Is not an [ETF](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) (has Morningstar fundamental data)\n",
    "\n",
    "###Why These Criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting for primary shares and common stock helps us select only a single security for each company. In general, primary shares are a good representative asset of a company so we will select for these in our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADRs and GDRs are issuances in the US equity market for stocks that trade on other exchanges. Frequently, there is inherent risk associated with depositary receipts due to currency fluctuations so we exclude them from our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "OTC, WI, and LP securities are not tradeable with most brokers. As a result, we exclude them from our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to ranking and comparing securities, it rarely makes sense to compare ETFs with regular stocks. ETFs are composites without fundamental data. They derive their value from a larger group of securities. To avoid comparing apples and oranges, we exclude them from our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Creating Our Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a filter for each criterion and combine them together to create a `tradeable_stocks` filter. First, we need to import the Morningstar `Dataset` as well as the `IsPrimaryShares` builtin filter."
